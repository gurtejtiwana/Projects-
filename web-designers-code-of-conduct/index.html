  <h1>CODE OF CONDUCT</h1>
<h3>Upholding Honesty and Transparency</h3>
<p>I believe that honesty and transparency are the two most important factors in a Web designer's code of ethics. I will do my best to be transparent with a customer; if the project they want me to do is above my skill level, I will gladly recommend them to someone suitable. I will keep them updated as to how quickly I can do the desired work and advise them on any time constraints while keeping their required deadline in consideration.</p>
<p>I have always been interested by the notion of making and designing web sites. It is that same interest that has dragged me from different a educational background such as Law Enforcement/Political science to what I believe is my true calling,
Web design.</p>
<h3>Respect to Confidentiality</h3>
<p>I will not reveal private information about my customers, sharing information about clients is something I am very wary about. Nor will I help a client's competitor defame their competition under any circumstances.</p>
<h3>A Notion to Hard work and efficiency</h3>
<p>I will work to the best of my abilities to meet a client's deadline and produce quality product.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of flexibility in billing</h3>
<P>I will always be flexible in giving credit where credit is due, if a customer helps me finish the project faster by being hands-on alongside me, the cost shall be fairly adjusted.</P>
<h3>Open to constructive criticism and feedback</h3>
<p>We all have ideas. We all see things from a different perspective and our imaginations range from person to person. If a client is fair and has an opinion about my work, please feel free to share it with me as I see it as not only a chance to improve the product; but to bond as well.</p>
<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<p>I am always present for communication and am easy to reach. When working with me, always remember that it is not just the technical skills that you are here for, but also the soft skills. Those are also my strong points and I am always willing to communicate with my clients to meet a better result.</p>
