<h1>Landscaping Tips</h1>

<p>Plan before you buy. Sketch your landscape design on paper before you start planting
and building. Knowing exactly what you need and where you're going to put it helps
avoid wasting money.</p>

<p>Decide how much design you want. Although it's less expensive to build a square patio
or deck, it's no bargain if you find the result so unappealing that you don't use it. It may
be worth it to pay a designer to create a space that you can really use.</p>

<p>Buy in phases. Few people have the financial resources to landscape their property all
at once. Divide your project into phases, and pay as you go with funds on hand. You'll
save on loan or credit costs and be able to evaluate your progress and adjust plans
before moving to the next phase.</p>

<p>Don't assume cheaper is always better. Economics of scale being what they are, home
improvement warehouses typically offer the lowest prices for common plants and
hardscaping materials, such as lumber. However, they may not have the selection and
quality you find at more specialized sources. Also, a local specialty shop may provide
more personal service, expert advice, and guarantees, which are all helpful if you're a
novice. When installing a pond, for example, it may be worth it to pay more through a
source that specializes in water gardens, particularly if the staff can help you choose
and install equipment. Plant prices may be higher at specialty nurseries, but many offer
money-back guarantees on trees, shrubs, and bedding plants.</p>

<p>Accept cheaper when it's good enough. With some items, there's little difference in
quality between top-of-the-line and economy. Why pay more? Take advantage of a
home improvement warehouse's volume buying power for bargains on common annuals
and perennials, mulch, pavers, and containers. Inspect plants closely, however, a "big
box" store may not care for them the way a nursery would.</p>

<p>Time your purchases. What you buy can be as important as where you buy. Lumber for
outdoor projects is often cheaper during winter months. Save money on trees, shrubs,
perennials, soil, and mulch by buying late in the season. Don't rush out to buy newly
released plant varieties, which may be expensive initially because supply is low and
demand is high. When production catches up in a few years, prices will likely drop.
Shop online and mail-order sources. Catalogs and websites expand your choices,
especially for rare plants and specialized products. Shopping online or by phone is
convenient, and prices may be lower than in stores, but don't forget to include shipping
costs when comparing prices with local sources.</p>

<p>Check alternate resources. Look beyond stores and catalogs for bargains. Arboretums
and botanical centers often hold plant sales, and neighbors may have extra perennials
to share. Some cities offer free mulch and compost, and construction and demolition
sites can be sources of bricks and stones.</p>

<p>Be sociable. Being neighborly cuts costs. Share the rental fee for tillers, chippers, or
other heavy equipment with others on the block, then take turns and save.</p>
