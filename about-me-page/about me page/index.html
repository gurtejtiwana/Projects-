  <h1>GURTEJ TIWANA</h1>
<h3>WEB DEVELOPER/DESIGNER</h3>
<p>A creative frontend web developer/designer dedicated to building and perfecting the performance and design of user centric
sites.</p>
<p>I have always been interested by the notion of making and designing web sites. It is that same interest that has dragged me from different a educational background such as Law Enforcement/Political science to what I believe is my true calling,
Web design.</p>
<p>Speaking of, my educational background consists of a two year diploma from Sheridan College in Brampton, Ontario. I also went to the University of Western Ontario for Political Science, before switching over to Web Design and development at McMaster University in 2019. I believe that my diverse background has helped me acquire a set of skills that will ensure good communication between a client and I. In today's world, soft skills are just as important as technical knowledge in the world of IT. Therefore, my ability to bond, eagerness to learn and be easy to cooperate/work with is something I like to call my specialty.</p>
<p>Carrying on with the pattern of segueing, my technical background is and always will be in a work in progress as there is so much to learn, and so much to absorb! These are the set of skills that I am either already familiar to, or am in the process of learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>ANGULAR</li>
<li>REACT</li>
<li>BOOTSTRAP</li>
<li>JSON</li>
<li>SASS</li>
<li>UX UI DESIGN</li>
