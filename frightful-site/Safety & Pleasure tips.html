			<h3>First-time horse buyers love advice, and the following is a list I have compiled over the years.  Although I have been riding Tennessee Walking Horses for years, I came from a Quarter/Horse and Arabian background and these tips will certainly work for any breed!  Please feel free to email me if you have a helpful tip and I would love to include it!<h3>

				<ol type="1">
				  <li> Do not tie your horse with a long lead.  I see this all the time where considerate owners tie their horses on a long line to the side of their trailer or a fence so that their horses can graze.  Your horse should not be able to lower its head to a position where it can get a foot over the rope.  I personally saw a horse which was tied this way get his foot around and over the rope, panic, and literally saw his foot into such an injury that he was rendered lame for life.  Each time anyone would approach him to untangle him, he would panic again, causing deeper cuts.</li>
					<br>
				  <li>Not in a trailer, either!  You will do your horse a favor to tie him short enough so that he cannot turn his head more than ninety degrees either way.  If he gets his head down and a foot over his lead, he can tear your trailer up while inflicting damage to himself, not to mention the difficulty in helping a panicking horse inside a trailer.</li>
          <br>
					<li>Do not leave halters on in the pasture or the stall.   You would not believe what a horse can get its halter hung on, including its own foot (while scratching its face).  Worst case scenario is death from a broken neck.</li>
          <br>
					<li>Breast straps are functional.  They are not just for decoration.  Flopping, loose breast straps are not holding the saddle in place, so adjust the straps where the breast strap fits snugly so the saddle will not slide back. </li>
          <br>
				  <li>Do not feed horses in a group.  No matter how much you think you know your horse, or how much you think your horse loves you, feed does to horses what money does to humans:  brings out the Neanderthal!  When you walk into a group (more than one) of horses with a feed bucket, a primeval instinct of survival kicks in, creating intense competition and when kicking at another horse to climb to the top of the hierarchy, a horse never checks to see that you are not in his line of fire before declaring war.  I personally saw a friend of mine get her arm broken this way, moments after I warned her, even though she was sure her horses would never hurt her.  She was lucky it was just her arm and not her head!</li>
          <br>
					<li>Pasture horses are happier, easier to enjoy.  Horses do not cause as much trouble and set up as many bad habits if they are allowed to be horses.  If you want your horse to stay pretty all year, stall him out of the damaging rays of the sun during the daytime and allow him to graze at night.  He will stay glossy and dark, but mentally healthier and happier.</li>
