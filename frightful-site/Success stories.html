			<p>We love to hear back from our customers who have purchased one of our horses and are now taking great care of them, there is nothing like seeing a great bond between man and horse!</p>

			<p>Here are a couple of pictures of Sweet Tater and me together. We renamed him Cisco and he is already answering to it. He is a VERY smart horse. Anyway, we love him already. Christine said it looked like I was leading him around by his lead rope the other day like I was walking a dog. I was just enjoying him so much that I did not want to turn him back out into the pasture where we are boarding him. Thanks again for everything.</p>

			<p>Greetings from Donna and Ernie. Ernie is having his first day of training with a packed horse. Usually I start with one horse that really knows his job and add the green one. I just do not have that luxury this time. We are making haste slowly and all is going well. Another month and we will be packing in the mountains. Thanks for all the photos of our trip, many folks here have enjoyed them and of course I was puffed up with pride.</p>

			<p>Just another view of Beau. I cant thank you enough for this beautiful horse. I do not know how I would have made it through the past year without my buddy. Thank you for him and thank you for all your words of encouragement. I have many angels to thank this year for the blessing of being a survivor. You are one of them. God bless you darling.</p>
